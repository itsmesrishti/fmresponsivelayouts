## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Use flexbox for the desktop layout (additional restriction I put on myself)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how I could achieve the desktop layout with flexbox by using flex-wrap, max-width, and order properties.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/): I had completed this game before getting started with FEM but I did it once again before starting the challenge to refresh my memory and I learned things I didn't pay attention to (like align-self, align-content) when I played the game first time.

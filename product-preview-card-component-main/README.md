### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how you can use <picture> tag to render diff images based on screen sizes.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
